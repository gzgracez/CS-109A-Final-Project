## Overview
For our final project, we used the Spotify API help Grace curate her playlist. We had three goals:
+ to create the best performing model to classify songs as in or out of Grace's playlist
+ to use that model to suggest new songs for Grace's playlist
+ to produce a user-friendly interface using jekyll to display our analysis, so that others can replicate our method on their playlists

Here is *emph* and **bold**.

Here is some inline math $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ and, of-course, E rules:

$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}  = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} . $$
