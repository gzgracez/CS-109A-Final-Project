## Motivation

Spotify is a popular music streaming platform that allows users to curate their own playlists. 
Currently, there are over 2 billion playlists on Spotify. 
Music recommender systems help users find songs to play personalized based on what they might like. 
We wanted to help Grace curate a Spotify playlist of songs she likes using the classification techniques we had learned in class.
The Spotify API allows us to download playlists with feature data for each song in the playlist.
We asked Grace to classify a set of songs into her playlist and another set of songs as songs she would not want to listen to.
Grace struggles to classify with words what makes a song fit into her vibe. 
We decided to use our techniques to solve the problem of finding the best classifying model for Grace's playlist, 
and then use that model to find her more songs for her playlist.

## Literature review 


You've listened to your playlist. And you've listened to it again. How can _you_ create a new playlist that is tailored to _your_ tastes? Let's find out.

For our CS 109A final project, we set off to construct models that will allow us to best categorize new songs as being either songs that you would like to have in your playlist or songs that you would likely not want to include in your playlist. Given your existing favorite playlist, we will attempt to construct a new playlist by using our models to predict whether a new song belongs in your new playlist and adding them accordingly.

Please feel free to navigate this website to learn more about our methodology.

QUESTION: Should we write something to automatically generate a new playlist? Would be cool...

>here is a quote

Here is *emph* and **bold**.

Here is some inline math $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ and, of-course, E rules:

$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}  = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} . $$
