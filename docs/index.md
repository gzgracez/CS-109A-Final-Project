## Overview
For our final project, we used the Spotify API help Grace curate her playlist. We had three goals:
+ to create the best performing model to classify songs as in or out of Grace's playlist
+ to use that model to suggest new songs for Grace's playlist
+ to produce a sleek interface using jekyll to display our analysis, so that others can replicate our method on their playlists

## Playlists
