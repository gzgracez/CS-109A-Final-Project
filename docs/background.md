## Motivation

Spotify is a popular music streaming platform that allows users to curate their own playlists. 
Music recommender systems help users find songs based on what they might like. 
We wanted to help Grace curate a Spotify playlist of her favorite songs using the classification techniques we had learned in class.
Grace struggles to classify with words what makes a song fit into her vibe. "I'd jam to Madison Thompson's 'Lonely Together,' but definitely not to Avicii's."
When words fail, data science might help. 
We decided to solve the problem of finding the best classification model for Grace's playlist, 
and then use that model to find her more songs for her playlist.
The Spotify API allows us to download playlists with feature data for each song in the playlist.
We asked Grace to label a set of songs as included in her playlist and another set of songs as songs she would not want to listen to.
We then constructed and analyzed classification models based on this data.



## Literature Review 
[Current Challenges and Visions in Music Recommender Systems Research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03208.pdf)
+ Biggest current issues in MRS: cold start, automatic playlist generation, and evaluation.
+ State-of-the-art techniques in playlist extension include collaborative filtering and Markov chain models
	- limitations include ordering of songs within playlists and incorporating situational characteristics that affect listeners
+ Future work includes incorporating personality, current emotional state, political situation, and cultural situation into music recommendations.

Here is *emph* and **bold**.

Here is some inline math $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ and, of-course, E rules:

$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}  = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} . $$
