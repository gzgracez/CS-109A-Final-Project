## Summary
For our final project, we used the Spotify API to curate the playlist of our friend Grace. We had three goals:
+ to create the best performing model to classify songs as in or out of Grace's playlist
+ to use that model to suggest new songs for Grace's playlist
+ to produce a user-friendly interface using jekyll to display our analysis, so that our method could be replicated for anyone's playlist

You've listened to your playlist. And you've listened to it again. How can _you_ create a new playlist that is tailored to _your_ tastes? Let's find out.

For our CS 109A final project, we set off to construct models that will allow us to best categorize new songs as being either songs that you would like to have in your playlist or songs that you would likely not want to include in your playlist. Given your existing favorite playlist, we will attempt to construct a new playlist by using our models to predict whether a new song belongs in your new playlist and adding them accordingly.

Please feel free to navigate this website to learn more about our methodology.

QUESTION: Should we write something to automatically generate a new playlist? Would be cool...

>here is a quote

Here is *emph* and **bold**.

Here is some inline math $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ and, of-course, E rules:

$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}  = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} . $$
