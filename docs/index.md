## Summary
For our final project, we created a best-performing model to help classify songs for Grace's playlist. 
We used the Spotify API to download features for songs Grace selected as playlist-worthy and playlist-unworthy.
After getting a grasp on the data, we built classifiers to predict whether a song should be in or out of her playlist.
Models we built include:
+ Baseline Logistic Regression
+ Logistic Regression With Quadratic Terms
+ Logistic Regression With L1 Regularization
+ Logistic Regression With L2 Regularization
+ k-Nearest Neighbors
+ Linear Discriminant Analysis
+ Decision Tree Classifier
+ Random Forest
+ Decision Tree Classifier with Bagging
+ Decision Tree Classifier with Boosting
+ Artificial Neural Network
