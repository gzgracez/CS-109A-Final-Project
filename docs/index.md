# Overview

For our final project, we created a best-performing model to help classify songs for Grace's playlist. 
We used the Spotify API to download features for songs Grace selected as playlist-worthy and playlist-unworthy.
After getting a grasp on the data, we built classifiers to predict whether a song should be in or out of her playlist.
The Decision Tree Classifier with Boosting was the best-performing model, improving our accuracy in the test set from 51.6% to 93.0%.
We used this model to classify a fresh set of songs for Grace, and she loved listening to her augmented playlist!
