    "content": "Background  Motivation  Approach  Literature ReviewMotivationSpotify is a popular music streaming platform that allows users to curate their own playlists. Music recommender systems help users find songs based on what they might like. We wanted to help Grace curate a Spotify playlist of her favorite songs using the classification techniques we learned in class.Grace struggles to classify with words what makes a song fit into her vibe. “I’d jam to Madison Thompson’s ‘Lonely Together,’ but definitely not to Avicii’s.”When words fail, data science might help. We decided to use techniques from Cs109a to solve the problem of finding the best classification model for Grace’s playlist, and then use that model to find her more songs for her playlist.We had three goals:  to create the best performing model to classify songs as in or out of Grace’s playlist  to use that model to suggest new songs for Grace’s playlist  to produce a sleek interface using jekyll to display our analysis, so that others can replicate our method on their playlistsApproachFirst, we asked Grace to label a set of songs as included in her playlist and another set of songs as songs she would not want to listen to.We used Spotify API to download her playlists with feature data for each song in the playlist.We then randomly split this data into a training and test set. Next, we built and fit a variety of classifiers for Grace’s playlist on the training set. Models we built include:  Logistic Regression  Logistic Regression With Quadratic Terms  Logistic Regression With L1 Regularization  Logistic Regression With L2 Regularization  k-Nearest Neighbors  Linear Discriminant Analysis  Quadratic Discriminant Analysis  Decision Tree Classifier  Random Forest  Decision Tree Classifier with Bagging  Decision Tree Classifier with Boosting  Artificial Neural NetworkFor each model, we evaluated its accuracy on both our training and and test set. Based on accuracy scores, we determined the classifier with the highest performance on the test set. Finally, we ran our best-performing model on a fresh set of songs and asked Grace if she liked her new playlist.Literature ReviewCurrent Challenges and Visions in Music Recommender Systems Research  Biggest current issues in MRS: cold start, automatic playlist generation, and evaluation.  State-of-the-art techniques in playlist extension include collaborative filtering and Markov chain models          limitations include ordering of songs within playlists and incorporating situational characteristics that affect listeners        Future work includes incorporating personality, current emotional state, political situation, and cultural situation into music recommendations.An Analysis of Approaches Taken in the ACM RecSys Challenge 2018  In 2018, Spotify sponsored a challenge involving addressing the automatic music playlist continuation problem  Most accurate classifiers involved:          Larger training sets produced better-performing models                  If training sets were subset, using a random subset of the playlist rather than the sequentially first songs in a playlist was most accurate in training a model                    Excluding “title” as meta-data for the playlist produced better models across the board      Solutions using the descriptors from the Spotify API were more efficient      TrailMix: An Ensemble Recommender System for Playlist Curation and Continuation  Successful RecSys project TrailMix compared 3 recommender models:          song clustering purely based on title      decorated neural collaborative filtering      decision tree        The title model performed very poorly compared to the other two models          The authors acknowledge that using analysis beyond the literal words, ex. incorporating NLP methods, could help        An ensemble of all three models performed bestWays Explanations Impact End Users’ Mental Models  This paper explored the explanations of music song recommenders to users  Part of enabling users to debug their models is explaining these agents to users well enough for them to build useful mental models  A kNN and bagged decision tree ensemble model was used to recommend songs  Completeness of explanations were more important than soundness in understanding models (ie–explaining everything as opposed to explaining only a part but explaining that part fully correctly)  They found that in general, comprehensive explanations were more useful than simple ones",

The boosted decision tree classifier, the random forest model, and the decision tree classifier with bagging performed best.We tuned the parameters and hyperparameters of each base model to maximize the accuracy score of each, which leads us to believe that we achieved the maximum possible classification accuracy given the constraints of our dataset.Finally, while usually time and space are usually considerations when evaluating different types of models, that was measured for this project because it wasn’t a constraint. However, a qualitative assessment of these metrics determined that all models were comparable with the exception of the neural nets that took additional time.Extending Our ModelWe can now try to generate a playlist customized to Grace’s taste using our chosen model. We will present the model with a list of songs that both Grace and the model have not seen before. We’ll then have the model assess whether these songs should be included in the playlist and then verify that with Grace’s opinion.# load in datasetfull_songs_df = pd.read_csv(&quot;data/spotify-test.csv&quot;)# drop unnecessary columnssongs_df = full_songs_df.drop(columns=['type', 'id', 'uri', 'track_href', 'analysis_url', 'name', 'artist', 'Unnamed: 0'])# recreating the best modelbest_abc = AdaBoostClassifier(DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2), n_estimators=800, learning_rate = 0.05)best_abc.fit(x_train, y_train)predictions = best_abc.predict(songs_df)print(&quot;Songs Selected for Grace's Playlist&quot;)for i in range(len(predictions)):    if predictions[i] == 1:        print(full_songs_df.loc[i]['name'])Songs Selected for Grace's PlaylistNever Seen Anything &quot;Quite Like You&quot; - AcousticCrazy World - Live from DublinWhatever You DoCome on Love1,000 YearsMachineAfter DarkSudden Love (Acoustic)GeorgiaI Don't Know About YouThis randomly selected dataset had 26 songs. These songs had never been classified by Grace before and our best model (the boosted decision tree classifier with a depth of 2) was used to predict whether songs would be included in her playlist. We then played all the songs in the dataset to Grace to see whether she would include them in her playlist. The model performed accurately, except for one song which she said she would not have added to her playlist (“I Don’t Know About You”). One reason for this mishap could be that our model isn’t 100% accurate, so this song could be by chance one of the ones it messes up; 1 missed song out of 26 is reasonable for a model with 93% accuracy. Another reason could be that Grace’s actual taste is different from how she made the playlist (perhaps she is in a different emotive or environmental state that temporally affects her preferences, or perhaps her underlying preferences have changed). Despite this error, overall, Grace was pleased that we could use data science to automate her playlist selection procees!Limitations and Future WorkData SizeWe generated a dataset by consolidating a large array of songs that vary in genre, language, tempo, rhythm, etc. We tried to curate a dataset that mimicked the variety of songs that Spotify has. Grace then had to go through these songs and classify whether she would like them in her playlist or not. Due to a multitude of constraints, we only had 5000 songs between both and training and test data. Ideally more songs that accurately capture the variety of songs that Spotify has would improve the training procedures for models.Data InclusionOutside of the side of the data set, there are other data sets that can be used discover new predictors or variables about songs. We can explore lyrics for example and see how that contributes to a model’s recommendations. Thus requires us expanding beyond the SpotifyAPI and exploring other data sets.Adapting PlaylistsThis entire project was built off of the preferences of one individual: Grace. While this proved to be a good proof of concept, future exploration should be done to analyze how the best model can help create playlists for others based upon their interests.Collaborative FilteringCollaborative filtering is another type of data modeling that is commonly used for recommendation algorithms. It is based on the fundamental idea that people perfer things similar to the things they’ve established they like. As such, it would be a good model to further investigate for this given project.Improve Neural NetworkOur neural network did not perform particularly well.While we tuned many hyperparameters, further tuning, exploring other network structures, and changing optimizers may help improve our network.Additionally, we could consider using convolutional neural networks.Dynamic PreferencesFinally, a review of the literature highlighted the importance of dynamic preferences.Individuals often adapt the music they want to listen to at a particular time based on their emotions or external situation.Allowing for a modification of models to include these parameters could be useful.For example, if Grace tracked the time of day that she added each song to her playlist and we could use that time as a feature, we could better suggest songs suited to a particular time of day.This could help adjust for temporal effects, such as desiring certain music during a morning run or commute to work, versus desiring different music for an evening shower, versus desiring different music for a party late at night.",

    "title": "Data Exploration",
    "content": "Data Exploration  Data Collection and Cleaning          Playlists      Spotify API        Data Description  Exploratory Data AnalysisData Collection and CleaningPlaylistsGrace created two playlists. The first includes random songs that Grace would include in her playlist (a “favorites” playlist), and the other playlist includes random songs that Grace would not include in her playlist (the “not-so-favorites” playlist). These two playlists are linked below.Grace’s Favorites PlaylistGrace’s Not-So-Favorites PlaylistSpotify APIWe extracted our data from these playlists by using the Spotify API to create a .csv file of songs and their features. We used the Spotify API’s user_playlist_tracks endpoint to collect track features, including track_ids, of the tracks in each of these playlists. We then used the audio_features endpoint to get additional features like danceability for each of our tracks. Finally, we added the in_playlist feature to each of our tracks, labeling them with a 1 if they were from the favorites playlist and a 0 indicating the not-so-favorites playlist.All of this data was written to a spotify.csv file.Data DescriptionOur data includes the following features:  danceability: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.  energy: Energy represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. A value of 0.0 is least energetic and 1.0 is most energetic.  key: The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class Notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.  loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values range between -60 and 0 db.  mode: Mode represents the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Mode is binary; major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.  speechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.  acousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.  instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.  liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.  valence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).  tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.  duration_ms: The duration of the track in milliseconds.  time_signature: An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).  popularity: The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past.  in_playlist: Response variable. Categorical variable for whether in playlist of desire. 1 if in playlist, 0 if not in playlist.The following features were recorded to help with visualization later, but not used as predictors in our analysis, as they are not characteristics of the music itself.  name: Song title  artist: First artist of song  type: The object type, always deemed ‘audio_features.’  id: The Spotify ID for the track.  uri: The Spotify URI for the track.  track_href: A link to the Web API endpoint providing full details of the track.  analysis_url: An HTTP URL to access the full audio analysis of this track. An access token is required to access this data.Exploratory Data AnalysisWe have 5060 songs in our initial analysis. 2650 are included in Grace’s playlist, and 2500 are not included in Grace’s playlist.Below are summary statistics for all the features we plan to analyze:            feature      mean      var      range      min      max                  acousticness      0.540199      1.267884e-01      9.959953e-01      0.000005      0.996              danceability      0.570920      2.931912e-02      9.162000e-01      0.061800      0.978              duration_ms      245718.492885      1.911563e+10      3.346533e+06      44507.000000      3391040.000              energy      0.439224      6.633419e-02      9.901450e-01      0.000855      0.991              instrumentalness      0.143138      9.302492e-02      9.870000e-01      0.000000      0.987              key      5.223913      1.251578e+01      1.100000e+01      0.000000      11.000              liveness      0.163377      1.798945e-02      9.800000e-01      0.012000      0.992              loudness      -10.270219      3.464989e+01      4.217600e+01      -42.476000      -0.300              mode      0.650198      2.274856e-01      1.000000e+00      0.000000      1.000              popularity      36.977470      4.773025e+02      1.000000e+02      0.000000      100.000              speechiness      0.070655      6.217856e-03      8.989000e-01      0.023100      0.922              tempo      117.657563      8.604272e+02      1.790410e+02      42.581000      221.622              time_signature      3.919763      1.655315e-01      5.000000e+00      0.000000      5.000              valence      0.425801      5.455384e-02      9.591000e-01      0.025900      0.985      We can see that all features have values that are expected as per the Spotify API documentation. To analyze each feature in more granularity we looked at density plots.Looking at the density plots above, we note some features that show clear differences in distribution between the playlist and non-playlist. While non-playlist songs contain a roughly uniform distribution of energy values, playlist songs spike at an energy level between 0.2-0.4.Acousticness in playlist tracks is much higher on average, spiking around 0.8, while non-playlist tracks most frequently have acousticness values around 0.1.Instrumentalness is a particularly interesting feature. While the distribution non-playlist tracks is bimodal, peaking at around 0 and 0.9, playlist tracks have a few very well-defined peaks between 0 and 0.3. We will note in advance that this may induce a risk of overfitting based on instrumentalness values.Playlist tracks have lower loudnesses on average, centering around -10, while non-playlist tracks -5.In terms of speechiness, the distribution for playlist tracks has a much lower variance and slightly lower expected value, centering around 0.3 while non-playlist tracks center around 0.4.Valence for non-playlist tracks is roughly uniformly distributed, while playlist tracks demonstrate a roughly normal distribution centered around 0.3.Finally in terms of popularity, playlist tracks show a peak in their distribution around 60, while non-playlist tracks have a more variable distribution with a peak between 45-55.The rest of the features are roughly similar in distribution between playlist and non-playlist tracks.The pairplot above demonstrates a few interesting things. First, we notice weakly positive correlations between loudness and energy, loudness and danceability, and danceablility and loudness. We also notice a negative correlation between acousticness and energy. The pairplot above demonstrates a few interesting things. First, we notice weakly positive correlations between loudness and energy, loudness and danceability, and danceablility and loudness. We also notice a negative correlation between acousticness and energy. These correlations will be useful to keep in mind if we conduct variable selection or regularization at a later point. Also, none of these pairwise plots show clear separability between the two playlists.",
